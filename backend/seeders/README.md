```

### Run individual seeder with sequelize-cli
```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:seed --seed 20250101000001-seed-departments.js
```

## Order Matters

Make sure to run seeders in the correct order due to foreign key dependencies:
1. Departments (must run first - no dependencies)
2. Products (independent of other seeders)
3. Operations (depends on Departments)

All seeders are named with timestamps to ensure proper execution order.
